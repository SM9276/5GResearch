=== Calibrated Bottom-Up Model ===
Pin = Ntrx * [ Pout/((1-σ_feed)*η_pa) + Prf + Pbb ] / [ (1-σ_dc)*(1-σ_ms)*(1-σ_cool) ]
Adjusted Parameters:
  Prf = 8.0 W (per chain)
  Pbb = 8.0 W (per chain)
  σ_feed = 0.000 (RRH configuration)
  η_pa = 0.380 (improved efficiency)
  σ_cool = 0.000 (no active cooling)

=== Linear Approximation ===
Pin(x) ≈ 3.7516 * x + 114.0481   (x > 0%)
Pin(0%) = 75.0 (sleep mode)

=== EARTH Reference Model (Table 8) ===
Pin(x) = 130.0 + 4.7 * x   (x > 0%)
Pin(0%) = 75.0 (sleep mode)
Where x is RF Output Power [%]
